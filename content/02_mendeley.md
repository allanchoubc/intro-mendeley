Mendeley is a combination of a desktop application and a website which helps you manage, share, and discover both content and research contacts. The website version was modeled after Last.fm, the social-networking music site; it incorporates social features into the academic process and allows users to share references with other users or groups, share new research, discover research trends, and get recommendations based on oneâ€™s interests. Mendeley is free to download. You can download the most recent version for Mac, Windows, or Linux operating systems [here](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop/).
